  text: 'It’s making a comeback. Cider is the original American beverage of choice,
    but it fell out of favor during Prohibition. We’re joining the national movement
    to reclaim cider for the States, and what better place to make our mark on Americana
    culture than in good ole Washington, DC? '

    Only showcasing producers within 200 miles of the Capitol building. Always gluten
    free. Not too sweet. More like a fine wine than a popsicle. '

    We have a few of our own concoctions and many ciders from Mid-Atlantic producers
    that are otherwise hard to find in DC. Our menu is always changing, but we’re
    always keeping it local.

  title: Our Pommeau
  desc: "WHAT THE HECK IS POMMEAU?! \nPommeau is a traditional French cordial made
    by blending raw, unfermented cider with an apple-based distillate (eau de vie)
    - think of it as the apple version of port wine. Best enjoyed as an aperitif or
    as an extremely versatile mixer, where pommeau can replace and elevate sweet vermouth
    in classic cocktails like the Manhattan and Negroni."

BrewProcess1:
  number-image: "/uploads/1@2x.png"
  title: Select
  description: Our home grown ciders start in local orchards. We choose cider apples
    known for complex flavors. Every production run is different. We grab what's growing
    well and will taste great in your cup!
BrewProcess2:
  number-image: "/uploads/2@2x.png"
  title: Press
  description: 'Next, we grind our apples into small bits in a process called milling.
    Then we''re ready to press! One bushel yields about 2.5 gallons of delicious juice. '
BrewProcess3:
  number-image: "/uploads/3@2x.png"
  title: Ferment
  description: We add yeast and other natural ingredients, like honey or fruit juice,
    to our fresh apple juice. Then it's time to sit back and let nature take her course.
    The yeast gets to work, turning those natural sugars into alcohol and CO<sub>2</sub>.

  title: Package  &  Pour
  description: Once the cider is ready, we package it up in bottles and kegs. It's
    ready to enjoy now, or we can wait a few months to develop more flavor. Come have
    a glass with us!
