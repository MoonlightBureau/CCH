  text: 'It’s making a comeback. Cider is the original American beverage of choice,
    but it fell out of favor during Prohibition. We’re joining the national movement
    to reclaim cider for the States, and what better place to make our mark on Americana
    culture than in good ole Washington, D.C.? '

  title: Ferment
  description: 'We add yeast and other natural ingredients, like honey or fruit juice,
    to our fresh apple juice. Then it''s time to sit back and let nature take her
    course. The yeast gets to work, turning those natural sugars into alcohol and
    CO2. '
