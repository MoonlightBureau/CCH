  text: 'It’s making a comeback. Cider is the original American beverage of choice,
    but it fell out of favor during Prohibition. We’re joining the national movement
    to reclaim cider for the States, and what better place to make our mark on Americana
    culture than in good ole Washington, D.C.? '

  text: 'At Capitol Cider House, we do cider right. No added chemicals or preservatives.
    Only showcasing producers within 200 miles of the Capitol building. Always gluten
    free. Not cloyingly sweet. More like a fine wine than a popsicle. '
local-source-text: All our goods are sourced from within 200 miles of the US Capitol
  Building. We have a few of our own concoctions and many ciders from Mid-Atlantic
  producers that are otherwise hard to find in DC. Our menu is always changing, but
  we’re always keeping it local.
