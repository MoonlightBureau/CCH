        <h3>Why Cider?</h3>
        <p>
            Even our country’s founding fathers were in the cider making game, making it the #1 preferred drink by the early colonists. Inspired by the history of this once go-to pub beverage, the resurgence is alive and flowing at Capitol Cider House. No longer is cider a syrupy, painfully sweet hangover regret, but a choice for the more adventurous.

        <h3>It’s DC as F*ck</h3>
        <p>
            Capitol Cider House is a part of the fiercely innovative city landscape that is DC culture. We’re proud to be from the same city as Go-go music, 1980s punk legends, the two Daves (Chappelle and Grohl) and mumbo sauce. DC is so fantastic even retired presidents like Barry (Obama) still live down the street. We rep DC hard and wanna help you love it too. So pop down and have a couple classic brews in our thriving neighborhood of Petworth.
